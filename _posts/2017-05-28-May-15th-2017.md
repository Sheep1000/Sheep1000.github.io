  <tr>
    <td>I learnt how to make boolean operators match a statement and how to make and's, not’s and or’s work. These operators basically work by making statements add up to get to a value:
If "Gamma" == “Gamma” and 3 * 7 <= 900
               Print “This worked quite well!”
               Return True </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>One of the main things that limited my learning was the fact that I got really frustrated when I got stuck and didn’t think logically to solve the problem. This meant that I started focusing on other people’s work instead of my own and lost valuable time doing this. My other weakness was that I was absorbed in conversation often which subtracted from the total amount of work that I could do in the one hour lesson. These are the two main habits that I need to change for next lesson and for all other lessons as well.</td>

    <td>Next time, on Nick Wiegandt does PYTHON in hour long lesson. Nick strives to get  to 27% in this fast moving series of quick coding teaching him how to code. Just joking guys. I am trying to get 27% percent next lesson but the whole part about a TV show is  a complete lie. Sorry, I know, you were hoping to see me slowly work through my code work in IT but we couldn’t make a show like that because no one would watch the whole thing. Next lesson I will try to persevere and not chat to others.</td>
