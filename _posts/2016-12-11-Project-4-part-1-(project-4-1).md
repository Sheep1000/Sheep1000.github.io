  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by reviewing what I had done last lesson by looking at the blog post from last week and reading the given target. We completed the introduction to the project and got a good portion of part 1 done. The most effective strategy was to have Seb code as I wired up the parts and took pictures for next lesson. Another strategy was for Seb to say where to put the wires and for me to attempt to put them in, even though they were really hard to get in for some slots. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The main thing that limited my learning was the fact that we couldn't get our wires into some of the slots such as 8F which got bent and malformed by the attempts to put a wire into it. Wiring is really, really hard. A habit that needs to worked on is my lack of dexterity in the smaller and bendier (Is that even a word?) wires.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will make sure that every wire is straight and I will focus purely on putting that particular wire in until it goes in, then I will move my focus to the next wire or maybe I’ll just get Seb to do it. I will improve my learning by getting past part 1 and improving my understanding of wiring to aspire for an A. I don’t think I can A* as I lack self-thinking. My target is to get past project 4-1. Peace.</td>
