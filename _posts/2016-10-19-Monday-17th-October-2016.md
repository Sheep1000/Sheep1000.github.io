    <td>I learnt how to make the computer collect information about people and how to show information about itself (me). It even said that it's favourite colour was orange (and still is) exactly like me! The best way to do this was copying one line of code at a time and then making the necessary adjustments at the end of all the lines. This was surprisingly the fastest way partly because I made no errors, ever, and partly because it was an effective strategy.</td>

    <td>Cookies!
This fact will never change. The main thing that limited my learning was the lack of a partener (Seb do better) but I got on pretty well except for when the 2 people who sat next to me (the only non rude phrase available) couldn’t work out how to plug in a cable (seriously?). Other than that the lesson went much better than I had ever expected. I still need to work on focus though because I still got distracted by the 'two people sitting next to me’ which needs to improve.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time on channel 5… Nah don’t worry, even I’m not that boring. Next time I will have Seb for the entire lesson (hopefully) so the work will be very fast. :). Maybe we’ll even get past project 2 part 1 (By the way all the titles Mean, Project 1 part (whatever number they are)). I will improve my learning by being the first person/people (people if Seb is there) to get past 2,1. I’m not entirely sure we’re doing this after half term. Bye for 2 weeks enjoy the holidays. Peace. :)</td>
