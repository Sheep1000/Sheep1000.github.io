# Tuesday the 13th June 2017

The first thing that we did when we got into the lesson was log on to our codecademy accounts. After we did this we were instructed to continue with our python project. In this lesson we had a cover teacher as our normal one was away on a trip. A lot of people were messing around and disconnecting keyboards and mice and other computational devices. These people distracted me and deducted from my learning. I also chatted. Next lesson I will focus on my work and make sure to benefit the most from my learning as possible.
