**Continued work on Spreadsheets**

I think I am starting to get the hang of this now, I managed to successfully create a stock sheet and managed to get it to upload things to an order form which made choosing products easier for people as you could put in a product code and a quantity and it would spit out a cost. You could do this for multiple rows and it would give you a total. This was my first successful Spreadsheets week.
