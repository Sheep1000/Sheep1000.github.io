**More Spreadsheets**

Today we did more work on spreadsheets, specifically on discounts and codes. We spent the lesson creating a discount function and melding it with the normal prices. The coding was difficult to understand and was a lot to take in but succeeded in the end. I had to work on it for homework as I was struggling to make the final code work, my mum told me what to do and demonstrated it for me. After this I understood what I had to do and coded it. It worked!
