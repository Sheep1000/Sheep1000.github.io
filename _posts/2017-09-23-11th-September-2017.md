Google spreadsheets

Hello peeps, I'm back again. Today we learnt about spreadsheets and some functions on them such as product and sum, we also learnt how to do tables and colour fill but primarily, we created a stock sheet that calculated the price of certain products. We also learnt how useful spreadsheets could be to a business. Without some of your own thinking though, you could apparently end up in McDonalds, reading the instructions even after the 50th time in a row that you have done it.
