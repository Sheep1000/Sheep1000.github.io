    <td>I learnt by persevering and tried to complete the 10th exercise in the unit. This taught me a lot about how to code, you basically try all the obvious options first, this will help later on as you can learn what not to do. Another choice is to try harder ones and get nowhere. I tried this at first without thinking and later realised I had made a mistake. I should have started with the common sense options and moved on to the more difficult ones.</td>
