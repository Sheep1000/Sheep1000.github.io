**A final lesson on Spreadsheets, I think**

Hello everyone, today we did yet another lesson on spreadsheets, I am led to believe that it is our final one but maybe not. This lesson we were finalising all the 'things' and I have finished my profit and loss sheet or my P+L sheet as most of you will know it. On it I have my costs and my sales, in the end it totaled up to around 750k profit per year which I am pretty happy with for a first time so yeah. Thanks for any of you who might have been active on this site checking often for my posts, they aren’t exactly the most exciting things in the world but they’ll do for my homework, I hope. See you after the holidays.
