    <td>I learnt by listening to the teacher and doing what he asked us to do, strangely enough, it worked! The teacher asked us to copy a set of code into a certain section of our scss files which makes the blog or website look like it's supposed to. I can’t find the error in my code so I may need to restart the whole thing. :(. This is not my idea of fun so I had better get it done sooner or later. Anyway, the most effective strategy was to listen and not fiddle with objects around me such as chairs or pencils. (Of course, I never did either). ;)</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The main thing that limited my learning was my lack of focus. The teacher who was giving us pointers didn’t notice but I wasn’t concentrating 100%of the time that we had in the 1 hour lesson. I need to work on that for next lesson. Come to think of it, I need to work on it for all my lessons. Another habit which needs to be changed is my constant time obsession. I look at my watch every 2 minutes (on average). It would be nice if someone has some ideas on that one. Oh yeah, by the way, cookies!</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will listen more carefully to the teacher and try to stop the watch thing for next time so that I can focus on the work at hand. Apparently, we might be using robotic arms at some point. The other class were already using them last Monday! I will improve my learning by working as hard as I can and focusing as much as possible. I will also try to not fiddle as much as last week because that is a bad habit.</td>
