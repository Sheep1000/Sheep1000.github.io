    <td>I learnt how to make the computer do math. This was good fun as I could watch it count down slowly to 0 by pretending to eat apples or pears. This became good fun when it did a simple problem that I had concocted for it to solve...and it did! The problem was 6x3-2. It amazed me when the number popped up as 16 but then I reminded myself that computers were extremely intelligent and could do 23 to the power of 23 in about 5 nanoseconds. At that point I became less amazed and more intrigued. This meant that I had got the code right!</td>

    <td>Cookies!
That was the last thing I said in this section so from now on it will always start with this amazing word...Cookies! This was the only thing that limited my learning. I was quite hungry as I had had very little breakfast that day so my mind floated around mainly thinking about cookies. Solution: Eat more for breakfast! This was my best focused lesson for the past month! I still need to work on it though because I can still improve. :)</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will still bring in a memory stick as it is an intelligent thing to do. Next time I will focus on focusing. Wait a second...that doesn't work because if I...oh whatever. Next time, (A.K.A) tomorrow, I will attempt to reach project four with flawless setup time and no errors in the coding. I will improve my learning by: focusing, listening, obedience and following the instructions. Have a great week. Peace.</td>
