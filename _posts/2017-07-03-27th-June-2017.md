Python continued…

Tuesday 27th June

Today we learnt about more Python stuff, I'll be honest with you, I was stuck all lesson!!! Couldn’t do a single thing. I tried as hard as I could but the section doesn’t make any sense! Either way, I helped other people to do some of the Python problems, I solved 3 by myself, this was of use to the others in my class but I couldn’t get farther. Next lesson I will ask the teacher for help and find out what to do. It seems to contradict itself in places but he’ll probably know the answer.
