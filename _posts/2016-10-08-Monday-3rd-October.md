    <td>I learnt that I needed to create a new repository because I still have red carpet. It is not currently a problem but it will be in the future. I also learnt that I forgot my memory stick so I have to find one for next lesson. This bit won't be a problem as I have one here beside me. On top of that I also learnt that the computers weren’t actually 90’s computers but the programs were similar to those in the 90’s.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The biggest limit was…
Messing around! I spent a lot of time chatting instead of working and this is one of my main weaknesses in class. I like many subjects and try to pay attention but I am prone to distractions. I need to focus during lessons so that I get all and any set work done. I am often a fast worker but there are frequent times when I’m not. If I get this sorted then I can get rewards such as cookies.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will BRING IN A MEMORY STICK. Also I grammar good have. This can help do the work as I can have proof. This will keep my butt out of detention. (Extra note prizes were handed out on Friday. I didn’t get one though.) I will also go to the lunchtime help from the teacher. This will help me fix the blog so that it is more enjoyable to read. Hope you enjoy your day. Peace.</td>
