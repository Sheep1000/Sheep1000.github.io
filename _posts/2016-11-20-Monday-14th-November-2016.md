  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by getting Seb to read the book to me and learning the patterns. I also found a way of doing the whole with more speed by getting Seb to just read out the part that I needed and I would fill in the gap with what was needed. This made everything easier as we could get it done in about 5 mins per section! The most effective strategy was to get Seb to stop saying the spaces, brackets and semicolons needed in the code because I knew where they were from memory. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>You know, I can't be bothered to keep putting "Cookies!" here. The trend ends now! Right now that that’s out the way let’s get started! The main thing that limited my learning was not putting all my focus into coding at the start. I was chatting with Seb, Felix, Horacio and Joe throughout the first 20 mins or so. This was the main section where we got very little work done.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will listen to Seb giving me code throughout the lesson, but seeing as this target is a long shot, I won’t chat with Joe or Felix except when they ask for help. Next time on channel 5… Nah! Don’t worry, I’m not a news presenter! I will improve my learning by focusing as much as possible and listening to those around me, well not everyone around me, just the teacher, Seb and people who ask for help! Peace!</td>
