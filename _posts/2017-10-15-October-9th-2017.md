**Costs on Spreadsheets**

This week our lesson was focused on costs of the business such as government tax, staff wages and rental of warehouses. These were some of the many costs that we spent the lesson discussing and working out ways to make them solvable. We began with Staffing costs, in my company we had 10 workers on the payroll, 5 supervisors, 5 managers and 1 CEO. The total cost of these people is to be determined in the next lesson as we have yet to make at total function for this sheet.
