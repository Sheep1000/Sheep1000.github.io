Tuesday 20th June 2017

In today's lesson, we continued with our code programme, PYTHON. I learnt how to use functions and how to work things like a PygLatin generator. I had to use functions to import maths from 'the webâ€™ and use it to find square roots and other similar things. I also learnt how to code some other things. Next lesson I will make sure that I reach 38% and not get distracted by others around me and not distract others from their learning of Python code.
