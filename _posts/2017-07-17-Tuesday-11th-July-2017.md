I wasn't really here…

I'll be honest with you, i wasn’t actually here this lesson because I was at a Drama rehearsal which was fun because it’s basically just messing around backstage and occasionally going onto stage for a scene or two. Here’s what I did to catch up:

* 1 hour of codecademy

* No distractions

* Lots of work done

* Was good...

I have been enjoying IT, this will be my last blog post for about 7-8 weeks. This is Nick, over and out.
