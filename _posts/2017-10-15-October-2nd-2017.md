**Another week on Spreadsheets**

This lesson was rather interesting, we created another few functions for the Order form like total, VAT and delivery of products. We also shored up some faulty code as one problem was that a buyer would have to buy 6 different items, no more and no less. After we fixed this problem by adding blanks to the mix, we then fixed some problems with the stock sheet and added colour coding to remaining number of items in stock for the purposes of not running out of stock.
